# distributed-uio-lti
MATLAB implementation of a Distributed Unknown Input Observer (D-UIO) for discrete-time observable LTI systems with unknown inputs. The method uses node-wise observability decomposition and distributed gain design for accurate state estimation with local data and neighbor communication.
